Q1) Write a PL/SQL program to find sum of two numbers.

Step 1: START
Step 2: Declare variables to store two numbers and sum.
Step 3: Read in values of two numbers.
Step 4: sum = num1 + num2
Step 5: Display the sum value.
Step 6: STOP


Q2) Write a PL/SQL program to check if a number is odd
    or even.

Step 1: START
Step 2: Declare variables to store a number and remainder.
Step 3: Read in value for number.
Step 4: Calculate remainder when dividing number by 2.
            remainder = num % 2
Step 5: If remainder = 0, then
            Display number is even
        Else
            Display number is odd
        End if
Step 6: STOP


Q3) Write a PL/SQL program to find largest of 3 numbers.

Step 1: START
Step 2: Declare and initialize 3 variables with numbers.
Step 3: If num1 > num2 and num1 > num3, then
            Display num1 is the largest number
        Else if num2 > num1 and num2 > num3, then
            Display num2 is the largest number
        Else
            Display num3 is the largest number
        End if
Step 4: STOP


Q4) Write a PL/SQL program to find average of first
    n natural numbers.

Step 1: START
Step 2: Declare variables to store values of number, counter,
        sum and average.
Step 3: Read in value of number.
Step 4: initialize sum to 0 and counter to 1.
Step 5: Begin loop
            sum = sum + counter
            counter = counter + 1
            If counter > num, then exit loop
        End loop
Step 6: Calculate average as sum / num
Step 7: Display values of sum and average.
Step 8: STOP


Q5) Write a PL/SQL program for displaying grade
    of students.

Step 1: START
Step 2: Declare a variables to store grade value.
Step 3: Read in value of grade.
Step 4: Switch grade
            If grade is A, then
                Display grade is Outstanding
            If grade is B, then
                Display grade is Excellent
            If grade is C, then
                Display grade is Very Good
            If grade is D, then
                Display grade is Average
            If grade is F, then
                Display grade is Poor
        End switch
Step 5: STOP
